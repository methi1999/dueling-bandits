# Description
We did a survey of some of the famous Dueling Bandit algorithms and compared them in 4 different environments. The final report can be found here: https://methi1999.github.io/pdf/bandit_report.pdf

# How to run
1. Run utils.py. It will run the entire experiment for 10 iterations to average out the noise.
2. Comment and uncomment the dataset part in the beginning to run the experiment on different datasets.
3. A .json file will be dumped with the cumulative regret in the form of a Python list.
